<h1>EXPERIENCE</h1>
<hr/>
<p>Throughout my career in software development, I have gained hands-on experience in a wide range of technologies and development methodologies. Starting with foundational languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I have progressively expanded my expertise to include server-side programming (using languages like Python, Java, and Node.js) and database management (working with SQL and NoSQL systems). My experience spans both front-end and back-end development, allowing me to build end-to-end applications that are both user-friendly and highly efficient. I am well-versed in agile development practices and have worked in cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality software on time. Additionally, I am comfortable using version control systems like Git, collaborating through platforms such as GitHub and GitLab. Over the years, I have honed my problem-solving abilities and become adept at debugging complex issues, optimizing code, and ensuring scalability. This diverse background has not only sharpened my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of how technology can be leveraged to meet user needs and drive business growth.</p>
