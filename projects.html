    <HR/>
    <P> Throughout my web development journey, I have worked on a diverse range of projects, each honing my skills in creating dynamic, responsive, and user-centered websites. I have built several front-end interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring cross-browser compatibility and optimal user experience across devices. On the back-end, I have developed robust server-side functionality using technologies like Node.js, Express, and Python, often integrating databases such as MongoDB and MySQL to manage and store data efficiently. My projects have included everything from simple static websites to complex, data-driven applications, where Iâ€™ve applied best practices in coding, performance optimization, and security. I am also experienced with modern development tools and frameworks, such as React and Vue.js, which allow me to create seamless, interactive user interfaces. Additionally, I am familiar with deployment workflows and cloud hosting platforms like AWS and Heroku, ensuring my projects are scalable and accessible. Each project has been a valuable opportunity to deepen my understanding of web technologies and further refine my ability to deliver high-quality, fully-functional web applications.</P>
